            &emsp;The proliferation of the internet brought with it a new age of communication.
            The power or people began to surface with new companies seeking to take advantage of our inherent social natures.
            With companies such as Digg and Youtube using its user base as the content curators, they were able to compete with the establishment in a new and profound way.
            The power was finally in the hands of the ordinary person who determined what media they wanted to consume.
            Digg used the idea of making its users responsible for curating its content and determining which stories were worthy of more attention, thereby making a more democratized system of news rather than the traditional system of media conglomerates determining the headlines.
            Youtube also went against the grain of traditional media companies by making the user able to upload and create their own content for a wide audience.
            People could now be their own content creators and reach vast audiences without the need for anything except a camera.

            &emsp;The invention of the mp3 was crucial in the development of more power to the people.
            With its invention, music became more accessible for many people.
            The invention of media players such as Winamp allowed for music to be played on any computer which was liberating compared to older methods of media consumption.
            This also propagated a need for peers to share files.
            Thatâ€™s where Napster came in. It was developed to be a simple P2P or peer-to-peer network where users could search for a given file and download it from another person on the network.
            It grew rapidly and traditional music sales went down by 80% as a result. This alerted record labels to the threat of Napster.
            They were losing revenue and were determined to stop the illegal sharing of intellectual property.
            The courts determined that it was illegal and shut Napster down, but the idea was already out there and other P2P networks arose to take its place.
            Eventually Apple and iTunes made it possible for individual purchasing of songs possible with DRM protection which prevented sharing of files.

            &emsp;Youtube also faced similar issues with traditional media companies such as Viacom.
            Many of its users were uploading content that was copyrighted.
            It had to develop a system to take content down when requested and prevent users from posting copyrighted videos.
            Traditional media companies were also losing revenue because of Youtube as many users opted to use it versus watching traditional media.
            Fortunately, Youtube was bought out by Google and was able to withstand the pressure and legal actions of traditional media companies.

            &emsp;The new generation of companies that provided a social platform for interaction were Myspace and Facebook.
            Both were social media companies that allowed users to create and display content of their choosing as well as connect with others on the platform.
            Myspace was a market leader in the space and was widely popular as many users customized their pages and used it to connect with others.
            It was bought by Rupert Murdoch in an attempt to embrace the new age of social and media change.
            Facebook was created to be more ambitious as it was primarily a social graph which wanted to create a network of all individuals and connect them using their platform.
            They strived to cater to the user by targeting them with content that they would want to see.
            Eventually these two would compete for dominance and only one winner would be declared.
