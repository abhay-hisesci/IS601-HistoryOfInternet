            &emsp;The internet changed the way information was shared. After the browser wars, the internet was gaining more popularity and individuals were starting to integrate it into their lives. One of the major flaws that posed a hurdle in making the internet seamless was that it was hard to find information. While there were many people putting information onto the internet, there was no way people around the world could find the information they were looking for without direction from the publisher. This is when google came into play. Google believed that they can make their searching algorithm into a company that pulls in a revenue of 10 billion a year. They were rejected by many investors and searching companies before they found funding for their idea. 
        <p>
            &emsp;  While the searching algorithm was a hit, it was hard to make money from it. It solved the single most important problem of the internet but it was hard to find a way to profit from it. Google wanted to leave the users with a great experience without flashy advertisements like yahoo and other websites. Google followed the moves of Gross, who cracked the riddle of internet marketing. Google used internet marketing to raise revenues to billions and this business model also helped other companies profit. Toyota sales went up because of Google's advertisement.
