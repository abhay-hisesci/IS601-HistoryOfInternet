            &emsp;The invention of the internet changed the way the world worked. In 1982 alone, the internet contributed to one third of the United States overall GDP. The internet allowed for a sharing of information and knowledge which changed how organizations functioned. The internet was built on the principle of distributed network so that no one switch could control the entire network. To create communication via the internet, packets were created. Packets worked when information was assigned to head to encode the origin and the destination of the packet. When the communication was too big to travel together, the packets were split and would find their own separate way to the destination. This allowed for the network to work even more efficiently then the telephone even if a segment of the network was not working. In 1966 Bob Tailor wanted to create a more efficient way of resource sharing. Tailor recruited Roberts to help solve this problem. Roberts decided to connect each major computer to a smaller processor and have the processors communicate with each other. This made the universities that had computers more willing to participate in the experiment because it would not interfere with the computer itself.

            &emsp;What stops the packet from circulating forever? How can packets be limited to not be of infinite quantity? These were difficult questions that needed to be solved. September 1, 1969 the first forerunner of the modern computer arrived at UCLA. This went on to become a success. In 1971, there were 18 mainframe computers. In 1972, the arpnet had fewer than 25 sites online. On June 9th 1999, the government put the internet in the hands of the public so that it is not owned by any one person. This was a major leap for the internet because it increased competition, innovation, and usage of the internet. This is when the world wide web was created (www).
