            &emsp;The mid 1990s was the start of the new internet age where companies began innovating and harnessing the real power of the internet.
            New startups began using the internet to their advantage and setting up a new model of businesses that created ecommerce.
            Ebay and Amazon were the first successful companies to be created from this.
            They both emphasized using the internet to make their products more accessible.
            In the case of Ebay, which is an online auction platform, the goal was to make auctions accessible for all users where they can purchase otherwise inaccessible items from around the globe.
            Making the business user oriented and focusing on the customer as well as integrating the internet into making this a reality helped them be successful.
            Amazon started as an online book retailer. They focused on providing the customer with the best deals coupled with their own reviews on the items for sale to help with the purchasing process.
            This customer focused business model proved very successful for both companies.

            &emsp;These two companies took advantage of the rapid innovation happening in the field of semiconductors and communications.
            The advances in smaller and more efficient semiconductors meant that computers were becoming more compact and in turn more affordable to produce.
            This allowed more households to buy a computer. The other side of this was that more companies invested in connecting each computer to one another by building infrastructure.
            This allowed more computers to interconnect and communicate easily. This exponential growth allowed for Ebay and Amazon to rapidly grow their customer base and become successful companies.
            The widespread availability of the internet and cheap computers allowed for the dot com boom to begin.

            &emsp;Though many companies were born from this early internet boom, it did not last.
            There was a rush to develop a business that involved the internet to take advantage of the new customer base and many did so without sound business plans or market research.
            Amazon’s mantra of get big fast did not apply to every business because it could not work for every company out there.
            Many investors were not looking at market feasibility or the business outlook based on performance but speculating on the inherent value of the business because it was associated with the internet and ecommerce.
            This mad dash to be the first to invest in the next Ebay or Amazon led many to give large sums of capital to these unproven companies which started the bubble.
            The valuations of these companies were high but the companies were far from profitable and many were wasting investor money on things not related to the company’s growth such as frivolous parties and marketing during the Super Bowl.
            All this culminated in the bubble bursting in April 2000 known as Black Friday soon after Alan Greenspan, the head of the Federal Reserve at the time, announced financial measures to curb the rampant speculation by increasing interest rates to an all-time high.
            At the end of it all, nearly two thirds of the Nasdaq’s market capitalization was wiped out and many companies went bankrupt.
            The rush to adapt a new technology into a new business and the rampant speculation by investors and Wall Street led to one of the greatest financial bubbles and market crashes.
