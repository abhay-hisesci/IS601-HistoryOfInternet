            &emsp;Although the internet was made public by the government, it was not easy to use for the average users. To solve this issue, a group from Illonios created Mosaic, the first ever internet browser that made it easy to search the internet for the average person. During their beta testing, they were only able to get 12 volunteers. Once the 12 were enlisted in the beta testing, the browser went viral. To take this concept global, Jim Clark decided to invest in Mosaic. Microsoft did not support the free access to the browser and instead wanted to have users pay a fee. Gates was a superpower in the tech industry and was able to tackle every type of tech problem he put his mind to. However, when he tried to take on the browsing industry, Mosaic put a huge roadblock in his way. This made Gates turn back and decide not to pursue.

            &emsp;On October 13th, 1994 netscape’s new browser hit the market and it was an instant success. Companies that have the most power are SAAS (software platforms) that other companies use to run other software. Bill Gates understood that this was a huge threat to Microsoft and decided to change the direction of his company and match and beat netscape’s browser. Gary Reback was hired by netscape to help circumvent the threat that Bill Gates posed. During a meeting with Microsoft and Netscape, Netscape felt that Microsoft had broken the antitrust laws and immediately after the meeting alerted the US government about what had happened. Microsoft felt that the meeting had been set up and that there was a rat in the company. When Netscape went public, their stocks went through the roof and it was the highest IPO in history. Netscape became arrogant in their approach with their clients, partners, and became confrontational with Microsoft. Microsoft decided to demolish Netscape by copying their moves and chipping away at their market share percentage by percentage. Bill Gate By September 1997, the browser war was over and Microsoft was triumphant.
